                <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                 <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>
    
                 <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

                   <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, 
                     our home that must be defended like a holy relic. 
                     The Earth was absolutely round.
                      Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea,
                      pretty and blue, was the Earth. 
                      I put up my thumb and shut one eye, 
                      and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
